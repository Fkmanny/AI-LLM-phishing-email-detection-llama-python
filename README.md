## Overview
This project implements an AI-powered phishing email detection system using a multi-agent architecture with Llama LLM integration. The deployment involved creating specialized analysis agents (Content, URL, and Header analysis) running on Ubuntu Desktop VM (10.174.188.11) and a central orchestrator on Ubuntu Server (10.174.188.10), with testing conducted from a Kali Linux VM. The system first used the Llama 8B model but later switched to the smaller 3B version due to unexpected issues ðŸ«£. This change shows the process of optimizing and solving challenges while creating a strong, enterprise-level security AI tool. The areas I failed are included as well, to really help understand the process or overcome them incase you are trying to build something similar, so ensure you pay attention to details. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me on any social media platform.

NB: This is not a fully functional system tested in production. More refinements and optimizations would still be done to make it production-ready, A better LLM model would be used, and more agents would be added to the system. The system is more of a version 1.0.01 of the project, so expect more changes and improvements in the future.
